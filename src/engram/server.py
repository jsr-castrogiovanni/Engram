    """Commit a claim about the codebase to shared team memory.

    Use this when your agent discovers something worth preserving:
    a hidden side effect, a failed approach, an undocumented constraint,
    an architectural decision, or a configuration detail.

    IMPORTANT: Do not commit speculative or uncertain claims. Only commit
    facts your agent has verified through code reading, testing, or
    direct observation. Set confidence below 0.5 for uncertain claims.

    IMPORTANT: Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or credentials
    in the content field. The server will reject commits containing
    detected secrets.

    IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 5 times per task. Batch
    related discoveries into a single, well-structured claim.

    Parameters:
    - content: The claim in plain English. Be specific. Include service
      names, version numbers, config keys, and numeric values where
      relevant. BAD: "auth is broken". GOOD: "The auth service
      rate-limits to 1000 req/s per IP using a sliding window in Redis,
      configured via AUTH_RATE_LIMIT in .env".
    - scope: Hierarchical topic path. Examples: "auth", "payments/webhooks",
      "infra/docker". Use consistent scopes across your team.
    - confidence: 0.0-1.0. How certain is this claim? 1.0 = verified in
      code. 0.7 = observed behavior. 0.3 = inferred from context.
    - agent_id: Your agent identifier. Auto-generated if omitted.
    - corrects_lineage: If this claim corrects a previous one, pass the
      lineage_id of the claim being corrected. The old claim will be
      marked as superseded.
    - provenance: Optional evidence trail. File path, line number, test
      output, or tool call ID that generated this evidence. Facts with
      provenance are marked as verified in query results.
    - fact_type: "observation" (directly observed in code/tests/logs),
      "inference" (concluded from observations), or "decision"
      (architectural decision by humans or agents). Default: observation.
    - ttl_days: Optional time-to-live in days. When set, the fact
      automatically expires after this period. Useful for facts about
      external dependencies, API contracts, or infrastructure that
      change frequently. Default: null (no expiry).

    IMPORTANT: Claims marked with has_open_conflict=true are disputed.
    Do not treat them as settled facts. Check the conflict details before

    Parameters:
    - topic: What you want to know about. Be specific. BAD: "auth".
      GOOD: "How does the auth service handle JWT token refresh?"
    - scope: Optional filter. "auth" returns claims in "auth" and all
